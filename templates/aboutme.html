<P id="resfont" style="font-family: Alice;line-height: 150%;">Well to start! My name is Sunny Mazumder. I am currently pursuing B.Tech inComputer Science and Engineering,at NIT Silchar. Few things that really boosts my life and moral : JKM, my parents, my brother, friends, one special sister,my bike, coding and mediatation. Coding, riding motor cycle and medidation is something is what I am doing these days. I am also a veggie converted from a pure-non-veg. I prefer eating swatwik foods(which gives postitive energy according to ayurveda.) And oh yeah! I know a bit about ayurveda and different herbs. I have a tremendous passion for motor bikes. Its impossible for me to think my life without bike. and Yeah! those who couldn't figure out what JKM is : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali">JKM</a>is everything for me, my inspiration, aspiration, consipration, respiration, persipiration.  Swami Vivekananda helds a important position in my heart , brain and actions. I am deeply influenced by him. Also, I am a great admirer of Ramdev, especially for bringing Ayurveda to mainstream. The amazing gift of pranayam that our rishis had given to us were hidden unitl Ramdev baba arrived in the scenario. Pranayam is a life-changer stuff. 
  Oops! I am going too random! Lets start from beginning only.</P>
  <br>

  <img class="img-responsive"  src="static/images/aboutme2.png"> <p id="resfont" style="font-family: Alice;line-height: 150%;">It was around 8PM on Thurday,9th sep,1993 in a small place in North-East India,called Silchar, I was born.I was brought up in a middle class family. I have an elder brother,who is currently pursuing his masters from IIT,Ghy. My mother is a house-wife , while my father is a businessman. I was brought up in a moral and ethical atmosphere by my parents. My parents always made sure that I should accept my mistake, if any, by myself. If I did any thing good, they would appreciate me and If I did any "wrong" thing, they would say/do nothing. So that created a vacuum inside my mind echo-ing "mom and dad said nothing so probably that was not a good thing I did" and I tried not to do that "wrong" thing again. That approach created a positive, optimistic quality in me [which still resides inside me :) ]. I spent my childhood largely with a neighbour friend and a old lady, who also lived in my neighbour. She had a great impact in my life. She would recite different stories to me and my "neighbour" friend. We used to spent the maximum time of the day in her home only. We would play several games, eat biscuits,choclates.We had fun...really those were great days.My life before school, was full of doing mischiefs, having fun, running here and there in the streets, playing any hell of game. It was a happy childhood in every aspect. </p>

  <img class="img-responsive"  src="static/images/aboutme3.png"></h3><p id="resfont" style="font-family: Alice;line-height: 150%;">Well! I still remember , the hell I cried on my first day. I went to an english School, Maharishi Vidya Mandir for my schooling. Although my first few years in school were not-so-good in terms of academic. However, slowly from class 3-4, I started to get the confidence that I can do well. With the hardwork and belief of my father, I started doing well in exams. Back then I became the regular member of the top-10 spot in the class. Years kept rolling, 2010 we had 10'boards. I probably had under-performed, getting a gpa of 9.6/10, which could have been better.oh By the way the best thing that happened to me during school life was the influence of thoughts of Swami Vivekananda on me. This extra-oridinary person had a great impact on me and my character.<br>
  class 11 started, all started to feel the heat of entrances and boards and dis-balance between these two. Class 11 and 12, these two years, had ultimate fun, cemented the friendship among friends. The level of friendship among friends reached different level. In the Class 12 Boards(CBSE), I secured distinction marks in every subjects to get an aggregate of 88.4% . I stood 3rd in my school( The best rank that I ever had in my school). After the boards, we were to face the entrance.I under-performed. The result was declared, I missed NIT Silchar, by 3 marks. Those were tough moments. Although I got a seat in SRM university, I decided to drop out and prepare for entrances again. This time I was prepared to do something better.And I did performed better in the entrances this time and got good ranks in few entrances(58 in Assam-CEE, 1195-WBJEE).I could have got admitted to likes of Jadavpur university but decied to opt for NIT Silchar, so that I can live with my parents. But still I failed to clear IIT-JEE and normalisation of Boards Marks in AIEEE dropped my ranks around 10k-12k. The drop-out year was a great lesson learning kind of experience.It was tough obviously but when I look back now , it was one of the best period of my life. and I learnt a big lesson: failure is not the end,infact, it can motivate you immensely and can help out bringing the best in You.</p>

  <img class="img-responsive"  src="static/images/aboutme4.png"></h3> 
  <p id="resfont" style="font-family: Alice;line-height: 150%;">
    After all the deals with entrances, admission and all . My college life officially started. 
    First year of college flashed by, before even I could realise.During the first semester only, I decided not to run after grades. Just mugging up something and getting good marks was something I was determined not to do. Rather I tried to concentrate on doing some stuffs that interested me. That thing was competitive programming. Although I am still a beginner only but I have developed a great love for the thing. I have fallen in love with data structures and algorithm. Again I must confirm, I am no expert , I am a novice in the world of competitive programming. Yeah I am a novice with small set of skills, but my love for competitive programming is huge. In the national annual competition of TCS- codevita, I participated in a team along with Aditya NK(college friend) secured an All India Rank of 144 among 50000+ teams. Well to say,my  college life has been more involved towards developing skills that I love not for what I will get good marks. Life is small, do what you love. I don't really remember ,also don't even care what marks I got in my 1st unit test in class 7, but I remember that I used to play cricket with friends during the whole summer vacation. Life is too small to waste for what you don't care. Life is abouting enjoying every moment, doing something what really makes you feel happy from inside. Life is about 4000 weekends and you really don't really want to spend your weekend doing stuffs which you don't love at all.

  <img class="img-responsive"  src="static/images/aboutme6.png">
  <p id="resfont" style="font-family: Alice;line-height: 150%;">
  As already mentioned, I am in deep love with competitive programming.Coding makes me alive. Its a kind of inspiration, motivation for me.Apart from coding competitions, I also sometime code in python and develop web apps using flask. And also sometimes try my hand at android programming.
  </p>

  <img class="img-responsive"  src="static/images/aboutme7.png"></h3>
  <p id="resfont" style="font-family: Alice;line-height: 150%;">I take a deep interest in ayurveda. Its mechanism, its working approach,its medicines and different herbs. In my leisure time, I like to research about various topics of ayurveda.</p>


  <img class="img-responsive"  src="static/images/aboutme8.png"></h3>
  <p id="resfont" style="font-family: Alice;line-height: 150%;">Every kid born in India one or other day must have dreamt of becoming a cricketer. Although I could not became one, but I do have a great passion for the game since 1999wcup. Yeah the passion might have degraded in the recent times. It was in the peak during the times of Sachin,Sourav,Rahul,VVS,Ponting,Zaheer Khan. Rahul Dravid is probably my favorite, I said "probably" because Sourav Ganguly is damn too close. Ricky ponting is also among my favorites. In the recent time, Glenn Maxwell is my straight forward favorite. Steven smith,Ellyse Perry, Trent Boult are also among the "like" -list.</p>

  <img class="img-responsive"  src="static/images/aboutme9.png"></h3>
  <p id="resfont" style="font-family: Alice;line-height: 150%;">2002 Wcup was the first time when I watched football seriously rather I understood it properly. Since 2002, Germany are my favorites. In clubs, Borussia Dortmund is my favorite team.Marco reus is my all time favorite player. Klose, lahm, podolski, Bastian, Muller,ozil,draxler, Gundogan, Hummels, Hazard, Oscar are among my favorite footballers. Yeah I am little skewed towards German-Football.<img  class="img-responsive" src="../static/images/smiley.png"></p>
