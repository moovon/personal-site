<p>There’s a lot of criticism for windows among developers.But I have been a great admirer of windows all over these years.
People would comeup with many issues in windows but given the huge variety of dealers that have to deal with eg all the
game driver companies and others, windows is a brilliant product. Linux never cares whether you can run GTA or photoshop
 or not. Windows does and not only for such few products , there’s a large set of customers that they have to satisfy and in that
 process, certainmistakes will be there ofcourse. I am not a linux hater,but, a windows lover.
</p>
<br><br>

<p>And I don’t think for a general programmer , windows or linux creates so huge difference. Windows have its command line,too
 and the powershell is quite comparable to bash.And even if you have issues with it, cygwin is always there to give you the
 bash feeling in windows.
</p>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Ok, lets come to the point. The windows lover and the python lovers often comes to a mismatch regarding installing the
python libraries using pip, which is supported in linux terminal but not in windows command prompt by default.
<br>
So Now we would enable the pip in windows command prompt
by following the given steps :

<br><br>
1) download the file and save it as get-pip.py
from : 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py" target="blank">here</a>
<br><br>
2) run “>python get-pip.py”
<br><br>
3)add the “C:/python34/scripts” to the environment variable
(my computer->properties->advanced system settings->advanced
->Environment Variables->variable path-> add “python path after the ‘;’ 
like xyzwhatever ; C:\python34\scripts;”)
<br><br>
4) Now start pipping
